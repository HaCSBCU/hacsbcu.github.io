								<h2>Code &amp; Chill</h2>
								<p>Code &amp; Chill is our flagship meetup and our most popular event (obviously)! Twice a week, the whole society gets together in the Students' Union pub
									for an evening of chilling, socialising, and just generally forgetting about the stresses of student life.</p>
								<h2>Hackathons</h2>
								<p>Hackathons are what our society lives for. There's a hackathon somewhere in the UK every weekend during term time, and you'll often find our menbers
									attending one. Hackathons fulfil the aims of our society; they encourage creativity and teamwork, while also helping to make you more employable.</p>
								<h2>Workshops</h2>
								<p>Don't get us wrong, the stuff we learn at uni is amazing. But, it doesn't always cover everything, and not all courses teach everything.
									We have some members that aren't computing students, so we run our own weekly Workshops to bridge the gaps in knowledge. Plus, it gives our
									members an excellent opportunity to share knowledge around.</p>
								<h2>Open Days</h2>
								<p>Attending a Birmingham City University Open Day? Why not come and say hi? We're usually in the Project Space on Level 4 of Millennium Point. Come and
									chat to us about student life, the society, hackathons, or anything else you might want to know. We'll be working on some society projects, so you can
									even try your hand at developing a product.
								</p>
								<h2>Freshers' Fair</h2>
								<p>Have you just enrolled at BCU? Welcome! If you've got an interest in Computing, we'd love for you to join us - it doesn't matter what you're here
									to study. Come and find us in the marquee in Eastside City Park. We may even have some swag to give away!
