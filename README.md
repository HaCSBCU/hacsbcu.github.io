# HaCS
This is the website for HaCS - the Hackathon and Computing Society at Birmingham City University. This website acts as our central resource for content and as a playground for our members to try out new ideas and work together with others.

We're open to contributions and are always improving our site. If there are any suggestions you might have or something you'd like to work on yourself feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/HaCSBCU/hacsbcu.github.io/issues/new).

If you are a BCU student and would like to contribute to this site but don't know how yet, it might be a good idea to drop us a message on our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hacsbcu/) or drop into one of our workshops.


## Contributing

As this project aims to be beginner friendly, please keep a friendly, open and collaborative attitude when communicating on this repository, and be respectful of everyone's abilities and ideas.
