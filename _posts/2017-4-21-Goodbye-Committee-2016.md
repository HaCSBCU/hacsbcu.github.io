Today, we elected a brand new committee to lead the society into 2017 and make it bigger, better, and stronger. The results of the election are as follows:
- President: Tom Seelig
- Vice President: Ollie Favell
- Technical Development: Pandelis Zembashis
- PR and Marketing: Bethany Simpson
- SU Liaison: Awating By-Election

Best of luck to all of the new committee members, and a big thank you to Oliver and the rest of the 2016/17 committee for making HaCS the society it is today.
